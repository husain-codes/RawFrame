# C-ImageLab

A lightweight, standalone C library for fundamental image processing operations built from scratch.

This project focuses on understanding raw pixel buffers, memory layout, stride handling, and algorithm implementation at a systems level.

## Goal
The goal of C-ImageLab is to implement core image processing algorithms in pure C without relying on high-level image processing frameworks.

This library is designed to:
- Strengthen low-level C programming skills
- Understand image memory layout and pixel formats
- Work directly with raw buffers (RGB / RGBA)
- Explore performance-aware algorithm implementation
- Simulate basic ISP-style processing pipelines
- It uses SDL2 only to display image
