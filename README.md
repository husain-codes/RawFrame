# Image Processing

This repository demonstrates image processing concepts
implemented at three levels:

1. Pure C (from scratch)
2. CImg library
3. OpenCV

## Motivation
As an Android Camera / Multimedia engineer, understanding
image processing fundamentals is critical for debugging
camera pipelines, ISP behavior, and performance issues.

## Folder Overview
- 01_c_programs: Pixel-level implementations
- 02_cimg_library: Lightweight abstraction
- 03_opencv: Industry-standard library usage
